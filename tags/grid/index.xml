      <description>We often see, in publications, a Kaplan-Meier survival plot, with a table of the number of subjects at risk at different time points aligned below the figure. I needed this type of plot (or really, matrices of such plots) for an upcoming publication. Of course, my preferred toolbox was R and the ggplot2 package.
There were other attempts to do this type of plot in ggplot2, mainly by Gary Collins and an anonymous author as seen on the ggplot2 mailing list.</description>

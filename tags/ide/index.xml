      <description>As most followers of R-bloggers.com and the Twitter #rstats know by now, RStudio is a new open-source IDE for R that was beta-released yesterday. I have started putting it through its paces within my R workflow, and my impressions are more than favorable. I also tried it out on my home Linux server in server mode.
RStudio is obviously designed by people who actually use R and code in R for their data analyses.</description>
